              Four friends, avid gamers with a passion for technology and <br />{" "}
              entrepreneurship, quit their jobs to start a gaming company that
              offered <br /> game development services along with the latest
              gadgets on rent for <br /> gamers to enjoy from the luxury of
              their homes! Thus Tacnik was born.
              <br /> The company was officially registered in 2023.

                Customer obsession was an innate quality and this helped quickly{" "}
                <br /> spread the word about our services across businesses. We
                began <br /> receiving requests to setup gaming zones for
                corporate annual days,
                <br /> team building and marketing events. This opportunity
                showcased the <br /> dearth of tech based engagement options for
                businesses and hence, we <br /> decided to expand our horizons
                by venturing into novel experience <br /> creation for audience
